This week, let's do some blues. I took a chorus from **Wynton Kelly** in the Miles Davis tune *Pfrancing* (0:58-1:20), off his album, Someday My Prince Will Come.

Let's see what we have:

+ He starts with the arpeggio, and descends with a repeating figure. 
+ Bars 5 and 6 see him repeating a similar min6 shape (or dom9 shape depending how you think of it), and the rhythm has that quarter note stop on the fourth beat repeated.
+ This creates a rhythmic expectation that gets betrayed by the following long phrase that carries over the half-chorus mark and only ends on bar 12. 
+ And after the ride through 3 tonal centers (or 4 if you count the Bb relative major), he plays some blues to end the chorus, tailed with his favorite rhythmic phase (Bar 15).
