<p class="message">
Thanks for visiting. Check out some of my other things</p>

I’m a musician and scientist now working at Baidu Research on speech recognition with neural networks.
I have a UC Berkeley cubed degree (BA Physics, PhD Materials Science, Postdoc Computational Neuroscience) and also did half of my postdoc at Stanford with Prof. Philip Wong.
I’ve been wanting to build a website for a *while* and now I have it.


## Other sites

Here’s a list:

* Some of my music can be found on my [Bandcamp](http://jesseengel.bandcamp.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Projects I’ve coded can be found on my [Github](http://github.com/jesseengel), account
* I like reading [CDM](http://createdigitalmusic.com)

Thanks for reading!
