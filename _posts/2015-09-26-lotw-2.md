This week, I decided to go for a **Wes Montgomery** lick from his tune *Four On Six* (1:15-1:35). Actually a whole chorus...

There's a lot of great stuff in there.

+ He starts with the arpeggio, and decends with a repeating figure. 
+ Bars 5 and 6 see him repeating a simlar min6 shape (or dom9 shape depending how you think of it), and the rhythm has that quarter note stop on the fourth beat repeated.
+ This creates a rhythmic expectation that gets betrayed by the following long phrase that carries over the half-chorus mark and only ends on bar 12. 
+ And after the ride through 3 tonal centers (or 4 if you count the Bb relative major), he plays some blues to end the chorus, tailed with his favorite rhythmic phase (Bar 15).
